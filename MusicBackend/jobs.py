"""In-process job registry and background worker.

The HTTP layer is intentionally thin: clients POST a job, then poll
``/status/{id}`` and pull ready chunks. All state lives here so server.py stays
small and the worker stays testable without spinning up uvicorn.

Concurrency model: one background ``threading.Thread`` per job. The MLX engine
holds the GPU exclusively (Apple unified memory; demucs serializes anyway), so
we serialize *runs* across jobs with a global lock; multiple jobs queue up
rather than fighting for the GPU.
