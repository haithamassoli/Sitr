"""Chunked separation + Opus encode.

The processor turns a video URL into a sequence of clean, music-free OGG/Opus
chunks. It coordinates the downloader, the engine, and the cache; it does not
know about HTTP, asyncio, or the extension.

Pipeline per chunk:

1. Slice the source audio precisely (download_source -> slice_source).
2. Run source separation (engine).
3. Mix the kept stems into one float32 audio array.
4. Trim to the playable window + apply a 10 ms anti-click fade.
5. Pipe WAV bytes through ffmpeg to encode as OGG/Opus and atomically write
   ``chunk_NNN.opus`` into the cache.
