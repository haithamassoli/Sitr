"""Audio acquisition via yt-dlp + ffmpeg.

We never touch yt-dlp's CLI; we use it as a Python library so the
"give me a WAV at this path" contract stays stable across CLI changes
upstream.

Public surfaces:

* :func:`probe`           - lightweight metadata fetch (title, duration, id).
* :func:`download_source` - pulls bestaudio for the *whole* video to a single
  compressed file (m4a / webm / opus). Idempotent; reuses an existing file.
* :func:`slice_source`    - cuts a precise [start, end) range out of a source
  file into a 44.1 kHz stereo WAV using ffmpeg.

We deliberately do *not* expose a "download just this range" function. yt-dlp's
``download_ranges`` cuts at the nearest preceding keyframe in the compressed
source, which can shift the start by 5-10 s for AAC/Opus streams — fine for
video previews, fatal for sample-accurate audio sync. The download-once-and-
slice approach gives sample-accurate cuts and is faster overall because it
avoids the per-chunk yt-dlp / JS-challenge overhead.
