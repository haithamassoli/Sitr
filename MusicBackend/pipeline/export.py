"""Helpers for assembling a finished job's chunks into a downloadable file.

These back the ``/audio?format=mp3`` and ``/video`` download endpoints. They're
kept out of ``server.py`` so they can be unit-tested without importing the
FastAPI app (which loads the separation engine at import time).

We join the per-chunk Opus files with ffmpeg's **concat filter** — one ``-i``
input per chunk, spliced in the filtergraph — not the concat *demuxer* (a list
file) and not raw byte concatenation. The distinction matters for A/V sync:

Each chunk is an independently-encoded Ogg/Opus file. Opus carries a fixed
encoder pre-skip (~6.5 ms of priming) and pads its final packet to a 20 ms
frame boundary; a file's header/granule positions let a decoder discard both so
a *single* file round-trips to its true length. The concat demuxer joins at the
packet/timestamp level, so those per-file priming/padding samples are NOT
trimmed at each boundary — every chunk lands a few ms long and the error
*accumulates*, dragging the audio progressively behind the video (negligible at
the start, a second or more by the end of a long video). Live playback hides
this because the extension schedules every chunk at an absolute position derived
from the video clock, re-syncing on each one; the export has no such anchor.

The concat *filter* decodes each input independently first, so each file's
pre-skip/end-padding is applied per-file and the splice is sample-accurate — no
per-boundary drift. The cost is one ffmpeg input per chunk (fine for the chunk
counts real videos produce).
